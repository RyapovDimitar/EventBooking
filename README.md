Booking Calendar

In our booking calendar, there is authentication using roles, having 1 possible user role by default - Admin. 

When a user is created, no role is assigned to him. 

When Admin role has been assigned to an user, he is able to manage the possible reservations -> to select dates, set a price and see an overview of the current bookings. Additionally, when selecting an already created booking, he can see the name of the person who has booked it.

Every user can make a booking. After a booking is made, no other user can book the same reservation. For clearer overview, a reservation is green by default and when it has been booked, it becomes red.
